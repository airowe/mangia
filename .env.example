# ============================================
# Mangia Monorepo Environment Variables
# ============================================
# Each app has its own .env file. See:
#   apps/mobile/.env.example  — Mobile app (EXPO_PUBLIC_* vars)
#   apps/api/.env.example     — API server (Clerk, Neon, AI keys)
#
# Do NOT put env vars in the monorepo root.
# Each package reads from its own directory.
