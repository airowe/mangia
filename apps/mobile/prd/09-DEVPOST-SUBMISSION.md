# Mangia — Devpost Submission

## Elevator Pitch (One-liner)

**Mangia turns the recipes you save into the meals you actually make — paste a link, get a grocery list, skip what's in your pantry.**

---

## Tagline Options

- "Stop saving. Start eating."
- "From saved to served."
- "Finally cook what you've been meaning to make."
- "Paste. Shop. Eat."

## Short Description (for Devpost)

Mangia — Italian for "eat!" — solves the gap between saving recipes and actually cooking them.

Paste any recipe URL (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or blog), and Mangia automatically extracts the ingredients, adds it to your "Want to Cook" queue, checks what you already have in your pantry, and generates a grocery list with only what you need to buy.

Built specifically for Eitan's audience of aspiring home cooks who are inundated with recipe content but struggle to go from "I saw this" to "it's on the table."

### The Problem

> "People, especially nowadays, are inundated with recipes, whether in their cookbooks or on social media. And I feel like actually getting it from something you see and wanna make to in your kitchen can be a challenge for people." — Eitan Bernath

We've all been there: you see an amazing recipe on TikTok, save it, and never make it. The saved folder grows. The cooking doesn't happen.

The friction is real:
- Recipes scattered across platforms
- No easy way to extract ingredients from video content  
- Manual grocery list creation is tedious
- Buying duplicates of things you already have

### The Solution: Mangia

Mangia (Italian for "eat!") bridges the gap from recipe inspiration to dinner on the table.

**How it works:**
1. **Paste any recipe URL** — TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or any recipe blog
2. **AI extracts ingredients** — No manual entry required
3. **Add to your "Want to Cook" queue** — Finally, one place for everything you want to make
4. **Check your pantry** — Tell Mangia what you already have
5. **Generate a smart grocery list** — Only shows what you need to buy, organized by store section

### Key Features

- **Universal Recipe Import** — Works with video URLs (TikTok, YouTube) and traditional recipe blogs
- **Smart Pantry Tracking** — Mark what you have, skip it on your grocery list
- **Ingredient Consolidation** — Making 3 recipes? Get one combined grocery list
- **"What Can I Make?"** — See which saved recipes match your current pantry (Premium)

### Monetization

**Free Tier:**
- 3 recipe imports per month
- Basic grocery list
- Manual pantry tracking

**Premium ($4.99/mo or $29.99/yr):**
- Unlimited recipe imports
- Smart pantry deduction
- "What Can I Make?" feature
- Cookbook collection tracking
- Grocery list export/share

### Built For Eitan's Audience

Eitan's 2.3M TikTok and 773K Instagram followers are exactly who Mangia serves: young, food-curious people who love discovering recipes but need help with the execution. Mangia turns passive scrolling into active cooking.

### Future Roadmap

Eitan also mentioned wanting cookbook integration:
> "If I can tell some app all the cookbooks I have in my collection... are there any recipes that have [my pantry items] in it?"

We've built the foundation for this with cookbook collection tracking and pantry-to-recipe matching. Full cookbook database integration is a longer-term goal pending publisher partnerships.
